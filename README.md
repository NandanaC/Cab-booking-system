## Project Details :

1. This project is a simulation for a cab booking system where a users log-in to their account, can update their wallet balances if required and book a cab by giving their destination and present locations. 
2. The distance between the 2 locations is calculated and the cost is displayed accordingly, to which the user may confirm the booking or cancel it entirely.
3. If more than 1 drivers are available at the present location of the customer, the driver with the best ratings is allotted to the customer.
4. In a situation when there is no driver available at the pick-up location, the driver with the best rating from the near-by locations is allotted to the customer booking a cab.

## Tools and Frameworks :

1. Java Swing UI
2. MySQL database

Coded and executed using Eclipse IDE.
